Main objectives for a https://carvel.dev[Carvel] integration with dataflow is to provide:

* We want to have exactly one common way to generate k8s resources
** Can generate set of samples automatically
** Can be used for all other use cases when deploying to k8s
* Automatically configure whole environment based on user choices
* Easy deployment without requiring existing external _binder_ or _database_
** Can deploy either rabbit or kafka as a binder
** Can deploy either mysql or postgres as a database
* Plain k8s templating using https://carvel.dev/ytt[ytt]
** Drive templating with template options
** Work with _kubectl_ without need _kapp_ or _kapp-controller_
* Package management using https://carvel.dev/kapp-controller[kapp-controller]
** Publish packages for dataflow versions
** Drive package deployment with given package options
* Step away if user configures external _binder_ or _database_

[NOTE]
====
While templating can deploy _binder_ and _database_ automatially it is not supported
production configuration and should be taken as a simple install as a trial to get
things up and running. It's highly advised to use proper deployment of _binder_ and
_database_ as automatic deployment and configuration of those are limited.
